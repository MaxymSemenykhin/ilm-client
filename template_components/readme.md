## Instructions

Download the balsamiq wireframes: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/382588/share/Content-Manager.pdf

Create a folder for each one here, named after the title of the Balsamiq slide (at the top of each).

Save the **Bootstrap Studio** project data in the folder as well as the html output. For example: login/login-template.html

Update the index.html file so that each link opens the appropriate template html (it will act as a table of contents.)

All external Bootstrap shoudld link to the CDN, not local.
